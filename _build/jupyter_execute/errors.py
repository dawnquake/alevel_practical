# 
# Collect here the possible reasons for errors, and how to deal with these errors
# 
# |Reason for Error | Description |  Solution to Error|
# | ---  | --- | --- |
# |Parallex error| When reading, need to read with line of vision parallel to the fine line division, and not at an angle | Read with line of vision parallel to the fine line division |
# |Zero error| The zero marker on the instrument might not be at the very beginning | Verify results with another instrument |
# | Ending or starting experiment too late or too early | Consistently -> Systematic; Not consistent -> Random | Use an automated digital tool instead of relying on human judgment to start or end experiment, or repeat the readings multiple times and take average |
