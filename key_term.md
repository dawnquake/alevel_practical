# Key Terms in A Level Practical

| Key Term | Definition | Why Useful? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Independent variable   | Varialble under investigation which is changed systematically  | 1st thing to identify |
| Dependent variable     | Variable measured to judge the effect of changing the dependent variable | 1st thing to identify |
| Control Variable       | Variable that must be kept constant to ensure a fair test is carried out | 1st thing to identify |
| Continuous Data        | Data that can be measured on an infinite scale | Curve(line) of best fit, i.e. temperature, time, rate of reaction |
| Categorical Data       | Data that can only take on certain limited set of values | Bar chart and error bars if possible, i.e. different metals, different catalyst |
| Range                  | Maximum minus the minimum  | When doing lin graph, the range on any axis must span at least half of the axis |
| Interval               | Difference between consecutive values | For example, 1 unit for 5 squares on the chart, or 1 unit for 5 squares or something, not 1 unit for 7 squares or some weirdly odd number |
| Anomaly or Outlier     | Data point outside the best fit and outside the margin of error  | Must be pointed out clearly on the graph and must be ignored when doing analysis |
| Precision              | Precise means the measured values are grouped close toghether, but does not neccesarily mean that the data values are close to the true value  |  |
| Accuracy               | Accurate means the measured values are close to the true value  |  |
| Error                  | The difference between the measured value and the true value , these are from you doing something wrong during the experiment | For example, you accidentally dropped a piece of enriched uranium and triggered a nuclear explosion |
| Uncertainty            | Quantification of what you are unsure about when measuring, these are there even if you have done everything right.  | For example, your ruler cannot measure on the nanometer scale |
| Random error           | Errors that haphazardly cause the measurement to deviate from the true (or expected) value |  |
| Systematic error       | Errors that always consistently cause the measurement to deviate from the true(or expected value) in the same way  |  |
| Zero error             |  A subtype of systematic error, where the error is caused by the instrument not beginning at zero, causing measurement to consistently be above or below |  |
| Percentage error       |  (Measured - True)/(True) * 100% |  |
| Median                 | Value in the middle when sorted | Better representative of data than mean when there are points skewing the graph |
|Mode | most common values|  |
